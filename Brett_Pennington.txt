EXPERIENCE
Sr Manager, Safe AI | Cruise | San Francisco, CA | 1/25 - Current
* Built a foundation model for human-likeness metrics for open loop trajectory evaluation.
* Prototyped a novel inference mechanism for trajectory diffusion that provides stronger faster sampling with stronger guarantees. 
* Established and led the Safe AI team which is responsible for online safety case assurance and long-tail data & eval strategies.
* Cultivated AI best practices with Cruise learnings and published standards such as ISO 8800.


Senior Staff Research Scientist | Cruise | San Francisco, CA | 6/23 - 12/24
* Led end-to-end re-architecture of L4 stack for better intersection performance. 
* Designed the solution above as machine learning with guardrails to provide guarantees while maintaining state of the art humanlike planning.
* Reduced optimizer solve times by 40% with data-driven feedback on feasibility and convergence.
* Drove simulation based test design, systems metrics, and results analysis to reduce flaky testing, pinpoint failure modes, and highlight improvements. 
* Landed an overhaul of planner sequencing to reduce AV stack latency by 90ms p95. 


Manager, Planning and Prediction | Rivian | Palo Alto, CA | 1/21-6/23
* Grew, supervised, and supported a team of up to 11 engineers; ranging from junior to senior staff engineers.
* Architected prediction, planning, and trajectory optimization for L3 autonomy.
* Introduced reinforcement learning (RL) for improved behavior planning in complex traffic scenarios.
* Led team responsible for writing a planning stack for next generation features, finishing the prototype one year ahead of schedule and later shipping to production.
* Co-lead the safety critical design of the ADAS application logic for L3+ autonomy.
* Designed and wrote a C++, real-time framework for extending application logic to improve development time and reduce bugs.
* Collaborated across 13,000 person organization to reduce duplicate work, define team objectives and identify opportunities for future.


Staff Engineer, Planning | Rivian | Palo Alto, CA | 7/20 -1/21
* Wrote an offline, non-convex solver for optimal paths on off-road terrain in python.
* Designed a path toolbox to store the optimal paths and load them in a dense, space-efficient representation in Matlab, Python, and C.
* Introduced TDD and modular software practices.
* Implemented online algorithms in C for fast multi-dimensional KNN lookups.


Member, Working Group on AV Decision Making | IEEE SA | 10/20-6/23
