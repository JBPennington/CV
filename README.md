Hi,
I'm a software engineer delivering solutions in robotics, controls systems, mathematics and dynamical systems. I consider myself an engineer first and a scientist second. As an engineer, I like to find the most effective and efficient solutions to any challenge. As a scientist, I'm fascinated by nature: the classical and quantum mechanics that declare it and the mathematics that define it. As a controls/machine learning engineer, I'm most excited to use engineering principles and mathematics to bend science to our advantage, solving the problems of everyday life!

<h2> EXPERIENCE </h2>

Manager, Planning and Prediction
Rivian, Palo Alto, CA                                                                                  Jan 2021 - Present
* Grew a team of 7 from 0 in half a year
* Led the team to write a planning stack for next generation features
* Finished the first version of the planning stack 1 year ahead of schedule
* Collaborated across the 13,000 person organization to reduce duplicate work, define team objectives, and identify opportunities for future
* Co-lead the safety critical design of the ADAS application logic for a next-gen architecture
* Architected prediction, behavior planning, motion planning, and trajectory optimization from the ground up
* Design and wrote a framework for extending application logic to improve development times and reduce bugs
* Constructed several prediction and planning libraries ranging from learned systems to classical planners


Staff Planning Engineer
Rivian, Palo Alto, CA                                                                               Jul 2020 - Dec 2020
* Wrote an offline, non-convex solver for optimal paths on off-road terrain
* Designed a path toolbox to store the optimal paths and load them in a dense, space-efficient representation in Matlab, Python, and C
* Implemented online algorithms in C for fast multi-dimensional KNN lookups
* Introduced TDD and modular software practices (again)


Advanced Controls Engineer
Boston Dynamics, Boston, MA                                                              Jul 2018 - Jun 2020
* Applied optimal control techniques for multi-objective and multi-bodied systems
* Implemented MPC/Planning for linear/non-linear systems 
* Designed proprioceptive sensing algorithms for workspace compliance and improved balancing of floating base robots
* Introduced TDD and modular software practices for dynamic systems


Software Engineer â€“ Motion Planning, Robotics & Controls  
Automata Tech, London, UK                                                                             Apr 2017 - Jul 2018
* Built custom kinematics, controls & motion planning libraries in C and modern C++
* Designed collision detection systems in embedded MISRA compliant C with low bandwidth constrictions
* Introduced Agile practices: Grew a team from 5 individuals into 3 cross-functional teams with 15 members in 9 months
 
Software Engineer                 
Cubic Transportation Systems, London, UK                                Apr 2016 - Apr 2017
* Maintained code running the London Transit (Oyster Card) environment along other global metropolitan transit systems (SF Clipper, new NYC Metrocard, Sydney Opal)
* Correlated high-speed, time-sensitive data streams in critical systems handling payments for +6 million users daily in less than 0.3 seconds each
* Delivered client-focused results quickly while adhering to sound development practices and refactoring a large and historic database along the way 


Controls Research Engineer                                 
University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL                                         Jan 2011 - Dec 2015
* Designed and synchronized embedded systems to enhance our testing ecosystem
* Programmed and modeled safety-critical high performance systems 
* Built adaptive and dependable systems in critical testing environments
* Researched diesel engine controls to advance sustainability and performance 

<h2> ENGINEERING SKILLS </h2>

Software Languages
* Dream in:                                                 Modern C++
* No problem writing:                                 C and Python
* Once upon a time I wrote:                         C++98, SQL, MATLAB, SIMULINK, Go
* Could stack-overflow my way through:         JS, JSX, R, Ruby
* Maybe one day:                                         Haskell, Rust

Planning
* Classical Behavior Planning (FSMs, PDDL-based, and hierarchical FSMs)
* Classical Motion Planning Techniques (graphs, trees, and gradients)
* Learned Planners (DQN and model-based)
* Trajectory Optimization (shooting and collocation based for online/offline work)

Work Style
* Self-starter - never stop learning
* Enjoy mentorship and leading
* Open and collaborative - the faster we iterate, the more honest we are, and the more collaborative we are, the better the end result will be
* Test-driven development and SOLID principles to build strong software foundations
