Hi,
I'm a software engineer delivering solutions in robotics, controls systems, mathematics and dynamical systems. I consider myself an engineer first and a scientist second. As an engineer, I like to find the most effective and efficient solutions to any challenge. As a scientist, I'm fascinated by nature: the classical and quantum mechanics that declare it and the mathematics that define it. As a controls/machine learning engineer, I'm most excited to use engineering principles and mathematics to bend science to our advantage, solving the problems of everyday life!

## HIGHLIGHTS
### Software Engineering
* Languages
  * Dream in: modern C++, Python, SIMULINK

  * Could stack-overflow my way through: JS, JSX, R, Go, Ruby
  * Maybe one day: Haskell, Rust
* Scientific computing: linear algebra, numerical optimization techniques, dynamical systems
* Real-time embedded systems
* Web & desktop environments
* Test-driven development
* SOLID principles
* SCRUM practices & agile methods

### Control Theory & Design
* Non-linear systems: robotic control (passive and compliant) and fluid/thermodynamics
